          Front End Development is building the visual things or mostly
          everything that you can see on a website. I use HTML, CSS, and
          Javascript frameworks to make a high quality responsive website or
          single-page apps.
          <br />
          <br />
          I write semantic HTML to ensure my HTML markup convey the underlying
          meaning of its content—not only its appearance. It is also ensured
          that the website will be responsive and accessible on all devices and
          all target audiences.
          <br />
          <br />
          I use React as my Javascript framework using the approach of
          component-based architecture. When complex state management are in
          need, Redux is my current way to go. I can say that I am confident in
          my React and Redux skill, but that doesn’t make me stop learning about
          React, Redux, or other modern Javascript technologies everyday.
          <br />
          <br />
          On the styling side, I can work with or without CSS frameworks. I am
          also currently trying to put Sass into my web development toolbox. On
          top of that, I am also learning web graphic and other interactive
          experiences using p5.js and Matter.js to make things more fun!
